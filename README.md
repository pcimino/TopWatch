TopWatch
========

Generated code for the TopWatch application, created using the TopWatch_Build repo. This is Part IIa of my [rambling tutorial](http://pcimino.blog.com/enyo/). Not necessarily a step-by-step, and not exactly lessons learned, somewhere in between, like "brunch."

Here, all I did was create a Git repository and update the README, add all the files that were in the [TopWatch_Build](https://github.com/pcimino/TopWatch_Build) \deploy\TopWatch\ directory. This will allow me to use that project as a submodule in Part III, where I start leveraging [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/).
